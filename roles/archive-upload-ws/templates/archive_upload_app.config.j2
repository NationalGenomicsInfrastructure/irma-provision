# Whitelisted DSMC warnings
# ANS1809W = a session with the TSM server has been disconnected: will retry again
# ANS2042W = a symbolic link to a file on other fs has been uploaded: acls/extended attributes might not be backed up
# ANS2250W = a TSM core file or crash report was found
#
# We do not want our archive jobs to get a failed state in upstream Arteria workflows due to DSMC's
# various return codes. In this case we do not care that we dropped the connection to PDC, and then
# restored it and successfully uploaded everything. We do not also care that the file permissions
# on a symlink couldn't be set perfectly. And we do not want the upload to have failed just because
# there is some old crash report laying around (as TSM generates those for various reasons). 
# We're interested in the times when TSM actually DO crash though, but that shouldn't stop other
# jobs to succeed.
