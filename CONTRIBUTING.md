In addition to using Pull Requests to contribute to this repo, also increment the version number in version.txt every time you make a pull request. If you fear several version will go by before your pull request is merged, simply ask the responible reviewer for a number.
Version.txt follows a simple MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION system. The most important thing is to update the number, and not whether the fix you made should be considered one or two revisions.

If you're using this code to deploy software on Irma, add a git tag that matches the current version number for the commit id that you intend to deploy. Take this opportunity to make it a release with a changelog if enough things has been changed to warrant one.
